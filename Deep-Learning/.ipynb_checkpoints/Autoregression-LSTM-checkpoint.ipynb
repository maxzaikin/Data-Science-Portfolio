    "**INTERIM CONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The undetneath mechanics is following:  \n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: This layer accepts a tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_length] = [32, 201]`, where each element represents a token (word) in a sequence of 201 tokens per batch. The input tensor is then passed to the Embedding layer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Embedding Layer**: The Embedding layer converts each token in the sequence to a vector of length EMBEDDING_DIM. In our example, each token is mapped to a vector of size 100, so the layer outputs a tensor with shape `[batch_size, seq_length, EMBEDDING_DIM] = [32, 201, 100]`. This transformation allows the model to work with dense, meaningful(i.e. a vector that captures essential information or patterns about the data it represents, in a way that’s useful for the task at hand) vector representations of words rather than raw integer tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Tokens with the same ID (i.e., the same word) will be mapped to identical vectors, regardless of where they appear—whether in the same sequence, across different batches, or in the entire corpus. This ensures that each word has a consistent embedding representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LSTM Layer**: The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer processes the tensor from the Embedding layer over 201 time steps for  each sequence in the batch, handling each vector from the embedding one at a time. This means:\n",
    "- each vector in the sequence (one token's embedding) is fed to the LSTM as 𝑥𝑡, representing the token at the current time step 𝑡.\n",
    "- the LSTM outputs a hidden state ℎ𝑡 at each step, representing the model’s updated understanding of the sequence up to that point. This hidden state can be thought of as the model's probability prediction for the next token in the sequence. \n",
    "- since LSTM param `return_sequences=True` is set, the LSTM will retain the hidden state ℎ𝑡 for every token in the sequence. This is essential for backpropagation, allowing the model to adjust each prediction by comparing it to the actual next token stored in \n",
    "𝑦. This setting is necessary for sequence-to-sequence tasks (like predicting the next word for each position in the sentence) rather than a single output. While backpropagation is applied through all time steps, return_sequences=True is specifically for capturing all time-step predictions in the output tensor.\n",
    "- after processing all tokens, the LSTM outputs a tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_length, N_UNITS] = [32, 201, 128]`, where each element in the sequence now has a 128-dimensional vector representing the hidden state for that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"./images/lstm.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dense Layer**: The Dense layer receives the tensor of shape `[32, 201, 128]` from the LSTM layer. It then calculates probabilities for each word in the vocabulary by:\n",
    "- multiplying each 128-dimensional hidden state vector by a weight matrix of shape `[128, VOCAB_SIZE] = [128, 10000]` and adding a bias vector of size `[10000,]`.\n",
    "- this results in an output of shape `[32, 201, 10000]`, where each 10,000-dimensional vector represents the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word. Each probability value represents how likely each word in the vocabulary is to follow the current sequence up to the respective token.\n",
    "The Dense layer combines weights across the Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers that contribute to predictions. The Dense layer’s main role is to transform each LSTM output to a vocabulary-sized probability distribution using the learned weights.\n",
    "The Dense layer’s weight matrix is initialized at model creation and is getting adjusted during training by backpropagating the loss. Each batch provides feedback to adjust the weights, aligning predictions with true next tokens(i.e. data saved in `y`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Learning Process**: During training, the Dense layer’s output probabilities for each word are compared to the actual next words in the sequence, forming a \"loss\" that tells the model how far its predictions were from reality. This difference is then backpropagated through the model to adjust the weights, particularly the Dense layer’s weight matrix. These adjusted weights allow the model to improve its predictions for the next word over time, capturing patterns in word sequences."

    "On the presented graph we see that our model's training loss decreases consistently, which indicates that the LSTM model is learning effectively. After 20 epochs, the loss appears to flatten out, approaching a value around 1.5, suggesting the model has converged or reached a plateau in training performance."
